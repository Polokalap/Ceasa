# How to use:
Go to the ```Cargo.toml``` file, and add this to the dependencies: ```ceasa = "0.1.1"```.
Then, go to your file and add this to the beggining of the file: ```use ceasa::*;```

Now you can use Ceasa!

# What is Ceasa?
I made Ceasa, because I saw a random video about why Rust is the new C, and I decided to learn it. As I was reading the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/). I saw how complicated some stuff was, and I was like: Can't I Automate that? And Ceasa Was born!

# What's in Ceasa?
- ```read()```  reads from the user and stores it. For example: ```meow = read();```. This stores the user input in the meow variable.
- ```randint(1, 10)``` this generates a number between the 2 given numbers. In our case, between 1 and 10.

- To The Rand Lib (I use their lib for randint >X3)
